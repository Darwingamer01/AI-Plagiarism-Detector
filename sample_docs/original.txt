Artificial intelligence has revolutionized modern computing. Machine learning algorithms enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to process information. Natural language processing allows computers to understand and generate human language. Computer vision enables machines to interpret and analyze visual information from the world.
